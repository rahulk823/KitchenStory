# kitchen-story

Kitchen Story is an e-commerce portal that lets people shop food items online. User can select any food item and order
it through a dummy payment gateway by logging into the site. Admin has the right to add and remove food-items, can view
users and their orders.

NOTE:

1. This application requires internet connection to add dishes. While adding dish you need to provide the url of the
   dish image, the application internally renders the url and convert the data to byte array and stores it into the
   database. Once the dish is stored into database, it doesn't require internet connection.

# Concepts and Algorithms used

1. Object-Oriented Programing - To Create objects and so on.
2. List, ArrayList, Map - To store and access data easily.
3. Streams - To access the data in the collection. It also makes the code easy to read, and it reduces no.of lines
4. Collections - To store and perform looping, searching, and sorting operations.

# Database and Structure

In the project root directory I've added a database.png image, in that you will find out the structure of the database.
Also, I've a provided database.sql file which contains the database, table creation and data that required to run the
program as well.

If you want to start from scratch without using the data in the database.sql file you can it, but you must create a
database and tables accordingly, then you can register yourself in the application by choosing the sign-up option. If
you sign-up using "j.riyazu@gmail.com" you will get admin rights by default, if not you will be registered as regular
user with no special rights. I recommend registering using "j.riyazu@gmail.com" email id with any data in other fields.

NOTE:

1. I'm using PostgreSQL database and, I've designed the database.sql file related to PostgreSQL database. Please make
   necessary changes if you are using different database.
2. Please make changes in application.yaml file in the root directory. It contains the database related configuration
   like driver, url, username and, password, please do make changes in that file as well as per user database.
